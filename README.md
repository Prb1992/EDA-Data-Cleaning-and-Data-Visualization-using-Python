EDA, Data Cleaning and Data Visualization on Zomato Dataset https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/himanshupoddar/zomato-bangalore-restaurants

Zomato is an Indian multinational food delivery company. This Zomato dataset taken from kaggle and this dataset contains information on restaurants in the city of Bengaluru, India.In this project the Bangalore restaurant data analysis is done. Main motive of this project is to get a model to predict the rating of the restaurdent rating using the features of the restaurant like menu items, location, price range etc.

For the analysis of the data following steps has been taken:

1)imported libraries :

libraries used:Numpy,Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn ,Machine learning Sklearn.

2)EDA,Data Cleaning, Data Modeling.

3)Data Visualization: Using plots to find relations between the features like:

.table booking rate vs normal rate

.resturant allowing table booking or not

.location vs rating

.rest type vs rating

.no.of resturant in location

.most famous resturant chain in bengaluru

4)feature enginering and selection:

. Correlation between variables.

.Decission tree regression

.Random tree regression

.Linear regression.

>Summary and Conclusion: .The most popular places for restaurants in Benagluru are BTM, Koramangala 5th Block, HSR, Indiranagar, and JP Nagar, with BTM boasting of nearly 4000 eateries.

.The top 5 locations according to avg rating of restaurants are Lavelle Road, Koramangala 3rd Block, St. Marks Road, Koramangala 5th Block and Church Street.

.Restaurants with higher ratings have generally received more votes than the restaurants with lower rating and they are more likely to offer table booking facility. Also, restaurants offering table booking facility are also generally more expensive.

.Restaurants offering more no. of cuisines are also on average rated better.

.Fine dining restaurants are much more expensive than casual dining restaurants and they are also usually rated better with much less variance in the ratings. Quick Bites and Casual Dining restaurants but are the most popular types of restaurant in Bengaluru on Zomato.

.Pubs and bars which offer more than 3 cuisines are all rated high. Similarly, Drinks & nightlife restaurants with multiple cuisines are also rated really highly.

.Buffet, drinks & nighlife, and pubs are much more expensive than eateries of the type desserts and delivery.

Linear regression Model Accuracy Score - 27%

Decision Tree Model Accuracy Score - 85.50%

Random Forest Model Accuracy Score - 87.74%

From the above acuuracy score we can see that Random Forest Model is best model as it gives good accuracy score comparing to other models.
